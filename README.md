> *View the presentation here [catchmatt.github.io / pres-HNK-GSC-Collab-Dev](http://catchmatt.github.io/pres-HNK-GSC-Collab-Dev)*

###Abstract
> During the functional design stage of the GSC Collaboration project the team identified that approximately 200 new project collaboration environments will need be generated each year. The technical specification is at the stage where architectural decisions must be made on how best to structure the information within the existing Heineken SharePoint 2010 farm.
> 
> In this session we will review the requirements that impact the information architecture and solution design decisions before examining the options that have been considered and discussing the pros and cons for each of the interested parties.
